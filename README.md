<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

### About The Project


As a person who cooks often, I am sometimes faced with the need to come up with something for dinner or lunch. 
That's why the app was created to help you choose a dinner idea.

In this app there are dish ideas for:
* Lacto-vegetarians
* Ovo-vegetarians
* For those who eat different types of meat

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.


### Built With


* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* GSAP
