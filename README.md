<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

### About The Project

I'm Oksana. I am a front-end developer from Belarus. I have learned HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, Figma, Gsap, Git.
And now Iâ€™m looking for a job where I can put my skills into practice, where I can become part of a team and benefit the company.
I try to learn something new every day and now I am learning React.


As a person who cooks often, I am sometimes faced with the need to come up with something for dinner or lunch. 
That's why the app was created to help you choose a dinner idea.

In this app there are dish ideas for:
* Lacto-vegetarians
* Ovo-vegetarians
* For those who eat different types of meat

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
